1.
Which of the following options is the best choice for adding an additional private field to the CaesarCipher class to make it easier to call the decrypt method on a string that was encrypted using an object of this class?

(i) The for loop variable in the for loop in the encrypt method.
(ii) The String input which is a parameter to the encrypt method.
(iii) The integer key which is a parameter to the constructor.
(iv) The character variable that reads one character at a time from the input String parameter in the encrypt method.

Correct : (iii)


2.
Which one of the following best describes the approach for the decrypt method that has one String parameter encrypted?
Assume decrypt can also access the key parameter that was used in the constructor, and that value is stored in an instance variable named mainKey in the constructor.

(i) Two lines are needed:
    CaesarCipher cc = new CaesarCipher(mainKey); 
    return cc.encrypt(encrypted);

(ii) Two lines are needed:
      CaesarCipher cc = new CaesarCipher(mainKey); 
      return encrypt(cc.encrypted);

(iii) Two lines are needed:
      CaesarCipher cc = new CaesarCipher(26); 
      return cc.encrypt(encrypted);

(iv) Two lines are needed:
      CaesarCipher cc = new CaesarCipher(26-mainKey); 
      return cc.encrypt(encrypted);

(v) Two lines are needed:
      CaesarCipher cc = new CaesarCipher(26-mainKey); 
      return encrypt(cc.encrypted);

(vi) Two lines are needed:
      CaesarCipher cc = new CaesarCipher(26-mainKey); 
      return encrypt(cc.encrypted);

Correct : (iv)
